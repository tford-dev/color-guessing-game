# color-guessing-game
This rgb color guessing game was inspired by a project from a course I took, however all of the code was written by me. To play the game, you must click the correct square color based off the CSS rgb color numbers at the top of the screen. The score is based off of the difference of unclicked squares and clicked squares.
